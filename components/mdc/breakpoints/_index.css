/* Details about Material Design's breakpoints can be found here:
 * https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints
 *
 * The `body` selector was included in these styles to give them a tiny bit more
 * specificity than a single CSS class selector. That lets these override normal
 * display rules but still be overridden when necessary. */

/*** To hide an element ABOVE a given breakpoint, use one of these: ***/

/* Above xsmall breakpoint: */
@media (min-width: 840px) {
  body .hide-above-tablet {
    display: none;
  }
}

/* Above small breakpoint: */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  body .hide-above-mobile {
    display: none;
  }
}
